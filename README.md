We are going to solve a customer classification Problem. The problem can be summarized as below:
   
    1. Our aim is to distinguish potential high-revenue customers from low-revenue ones for a 
    stockbroking firm based on customer details.
    
    2. The problem is a supervised classification problem.
    
Machine Learning Pipleline:

    1. Load the Data into python
    2. Split the data into train ingand validation (only when validation set is not provided separately)
    3. Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing
    4. Model Building
    5. Model Evaluation
    6. Iteration over to improve the performance
